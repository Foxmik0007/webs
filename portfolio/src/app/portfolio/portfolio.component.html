<h1>Welcome to my portofolio Website</h1>
<h4>Hello, my name is <em>Mika RAFARALAHY</em>, I am a second year software Engineering student at the <a href="https://uottawa.Ca">University of Ottawa</a></h4>
<p>I'm coming from Madagascar and started programming 4 years ago, but I really started to focus on it after I got my High school diploma.
  I love programming and I like try new things in this field.
  My favorite field in this domain is the creation of mobile application, especially Android Application. I used Android Studio form almost all of my mobile application project.
 I got experiences in developping web application too, for example this website were made using the <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular Framework</a>.
  Currently, my goal is to improve myself in this field and start my own software company once I graduate.<br/>
